# Internal DNS configuration.
# Kubernetes can create and mainatain its own DNS server to resolve service names
# into appropriate IP addresses. It's highly advisable to run such DNS server,
# as it greatly simplifies configuration of your applications - you can use
# service names instead of magic environment variables.
# You still must manually configure all your containers to use this DNS server,
# Kubernetes won't do this for you (yet).

# Turn this varable to 'false' to disable whole DNS configuration.

# Internal DNS domain name.
# This domain must not be used in your network. Services will be discoverable
# under <service-name>.<namespace>.<domainname>, e.g.
# myservice.default.kube.local

# IP address of the DNS server.
# Kubernetes will create a pod with several containers, serving as the DNS
# server and expose it under this IP address. The IP address must be from
# the range specified as kube_service_addresses above.
# And this is the IP address you should use as address of the DNS server
# in your containers.
